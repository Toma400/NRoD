### Origins
NRoD is attempt to learn Nim and also, to release game made in relatively short
time.  
The original concept (called NimRoD) was very basic text RPG idea reconstructed
from my older games - fantasy setting, location, some weapon and fights. Nothing
really captivating, but I kinda enjoy making such games.  

NRoD isn't much different in scope, but it changes two things:
- It is now post-apocalyptic
- It is graphical

This is because previous effort wasn't really much of challenge for me, and I
decided to raise the bar. And also, to finally have something that would be
quality-wise on par with my previous learning efforts.

### How to play?
You start the game from desert camp.
- **Travel** - travelling let you change locations and wander around the world
- **Hunt** - some locations allow you to hunt, so you can earn money
- **Shop** - some locations have shops with unique items you can buy with money
- **Items** - items bought in shop allow you to survive in harsh environment

There's no precise end goal for the game, you just need to survive in
post-apocalyptic environment you got into.

### Legacy mode
NRoD is shipped with legacy mode, allowing you to play terminal version of the
game. All systems are fully accessible through both modes, so you can play with
the same characters on graphical and terminal versions.
